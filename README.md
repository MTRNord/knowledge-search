# Knowledge Search

Knowledge search is a graph database based recommendation search trying to be
multi modal across sources and giving you better resultsthan a conventional
fulltext search does.

Please not that this is ALPHA software. It is mainly for personal use
so fixes will be slow or never happen. Features PRs are appreciated but I will
focus on implementing things that I care about.

## Commit Guideline

Please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). You can use the pre-commit script to ensure you
do use conventional commits by running `pre-commit install -t prepare-commit-msg -t commit-msg`
after [installing pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install).
